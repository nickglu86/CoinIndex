  "description": "The Kingdom of Bhutan uses Himalayan rivers to generate energy used to mine Bitcoin, local reports reveal.",
  "content": "Bhutan is bullish on Bitcoin ( BTC ). Following the revelation that the small Himalayan kingdom has been quietly accumulating crypto, the country is also mining Bitcoin. Moreover, the country of less than 800,000 people leverages green energy to power its Bitcoin mining operations. Known for its focus on “Gross National Happiness” and picturesque landscapes, Bhutan has found ways to harness its immense hydroelectric potential, which accounts for 30% of its gross domestic product. First reported in an exposé in local Bhutanese news and followed by inquiries from Forbes, Bhutanese officials confirmed that mining began when the price of Bitcoin was around $5,000 in April 2019. The price per Bitcoin has since soared to roughly $28,000 per coin at the time of writing. The kingdom has reportedly explored partnerships to expand its mining operations further. Notably, it is negotiating with Nasdaq-listed mining company Bitdeer to secure 100 megawatts of power for a Bitcoin mining data center in Bhutan. This partnership would increase Bitdeer’s mining capacity by about 12%. The scale of Bhutan’s mining operations remains a mystery, with little information available about the location, size and profitability of its mining farms. Some Druk Holding and Investments (DHI) employees have listed “crypto mining” as their tasks and skills on their LinkedIn profiles. It is also unclear why the government chose not to disclose this project to its citizens or international partners. However, it is known that the state-owned holding company DHI has invested millions of dollars in cryptocurrency holdings, with the funds managed on behalf of its people. Although mainstream media would indicate the contrary, Bitcoin mining is the world’s cleanest industry, with more than 50% of its energy sources being renewable or clean energy. Bitcoin mining advocates, such as MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor, explain that “99.92% of carbon emissions in the world are due to industrial uses of energy other than Bitcoin mining.“ Due to cheap, abundant hydroelectric power, DHI reported that Bhutan is an ideal destination for mining Bitcoin.

  "description": "The failure of First Republic Bank marks a volatile beginning to a busy macroeconomic week, while Bitcoin already faces downside pressure.",
  "content": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) starts a new week digesting major macroeconomic news as the United States sees the second-largest bank failure in its history. After a sideways weekend, BTC/USD was already volatile into the new weekly and monthly candle as the downside kicked in. After steadying below $29,000, BTC price action is already facing more potential pressure, with First Republic Bank being placed in public receivership and taken over by JPMorgan Chase. The move, announced during Asia trading but before the Wall Street open, precedes an already heavy week in which the Federal Reserve will reveal its next interest rate shift. With much to take in, the potential for continued surprises in crypto markets is clearly evident. Cointelegraph looks at these risks and more in the weekly rundown of crypto — specifically Bitcoin — price triggers. Classic flash volatility accompanied Bitcoin’s segue into a new weekly and monthly candle after April finished sideways . After closing out the month at $29,300, BTC/USD swiftly dived lower as bid liquidity was pulled from the Binance order book. This was responsible for delivering the local overnight lows of $28,289 on Bitstamp, according to monitoring resource Material Indicators, as tracked by data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView . #FireCharts 2.0 (beta) shows that when $29,150 was getting filled the bid ladder below was pulled and moved lower. #BTC price action sliced through the freshly open hole of illiquidity like a hot knife through butter. Seeing these moves play out in near realtime is a great way… pic.twitter.com/CnvRLRNcwc Bitcoin thus reached “bounce” targets for some, including Michaël van de Poppe, founder and CEO of trading firm Eight, who noted potential strength returning to altcoin markets. “Bitcoin didn’t hold $29,200 after multiple tests. Reached $28,300 for a bounce play. Good part; Altcoins are bouncing more firmly,” he summarized on the day. The day before, Van de Poppe had warned that without a reclaim of $30,000, Bitcoin would be unable to continue its uptrend and correctly predicted the eventual reversal level. Standard chop on #Bitcoin in the weekend. No breakout above $30K = no trigger for continuation. Holding above $29.2K, and still facing a potential correction to $28.3K as the ideal trigger for new longs. pic.twitter.com/3GJY8wImR9 Popular trader Crypto Tony meanwhile confirmed that he was waiting for $28,300 support to prove itself before taking a position. $BTC / $USD - Update Still not in a position yet, but looking here at the current support level we are on around $28,300. If we can maintain this level and hold, well this would be an entry for me on a long scalp Will need to see a few 4 hour candles to demonstrate demand pic.twitter.com/zCKnl1vxw3 The same level was also important for other traders, including Ninja, while Sun Tzu agreed that without a clear break into the $30,000 zone, the odds for extended downside remain. “We are still ranging within this important resistance zone,” he told Twitter followers on May 1. Still long bias for a bounce, added on the stop hunt. If we start closing below $28.3k, I will cut and long somewhere sub $28k for a bounce above $28.6k & bulls should be good for higher, if we keep stalling there... not good & likely cutting $BTC https://t.co/QFJzLzqveT pic.twitter.com/TYS7eGKxAF In strong contrast to last week , macroeconomic events will take center stage in the coming days, with the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting to decide on interest rate changes. Despite being heavily priced in by markets, the forthcoming 0.25% hike, likely to be announced at the May 3 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), is still not guaranteed. The picture remains complex. The Fed is hiking rates despite increasing signs of an inbound recession, while a more pressing danger comes in the form of the lingering banking crisis from March. As of May 1, First Republic Bank (FRB), shares of which plunged 75% in April alone, is being placed under public receivership by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Lenders, including PNC Financial Services Group, JPMorgan Chase and Citizens Financial Group, were among the banks bidding for FRB, with JPMorgan ultimately taking over. Reports previously indicated that the deal should have been completed and announced before the start of Asia trading, but this took longer , being announced at approximately 8:00 am UTC. First Republic seized by California regulator, JPMorgan to assume all deposits. First Republic is 2nd largest Bank Failure in US history. FDIC estimates a $13bn loss to deposit insurance fund. First Republic's 84 offices to reopen on Mon as JPMorgan Chase. https://t.co/QBKxbAj76M pic.twitter.com/zqlPRFcGUg As a sense of expectation hangs in the air, attention is focusing on the Fed, which risks unsettling the banking sector even more with a further rate hike under current circumstances. Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of crypto trading giant BitMEX, warned late last month that the U.S. might be caught between a rock and a hard place. “Look for the Fed to fix that issue by backstopping a larger slice of US bank balance sheets. Money printer go brrr,” part of Twitter activity read on April 29, with Hayes repeating a now-familiar $1 million long-term BTC price target. Bets on the Fed following through with the expected raise increased on the FRC news, with markets seeing a 90% chance of 0.25%, according to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool data. For Bitcoin traders, meanwhile, the FOMC event in itself marks a potential price turning point. “Seems like Bitcoin once again became stablecoin, this time around 29200$. Obviously due to the weekend but I think it's gonna stay relatively stable this way until Wednesday,” popular trader Jackis predicted before the monthly close. FOMC days tend to spark volatility across crypto markets, albeit often brief and characteristic of a “fakeout” as bid and ask liquidity is taken before prices return to prior levels. Despite current cold feet over BTC price strength, April avoided receiving the title of the worst month of 2023. Data from monitoring resource Coinglass shows overall returns for BTC/USD totaled 2.8%. These beat February, which returned no considerable gains, while preserving Bitcoin’s “green” record for the year. However, the picture looks less appetizing on weekly timeframes, with consolidatory weekly candles underscoring the stubborn nature of $30,000 resistance. Some remained optimistic, with the popular Twitter account Mickybull Crypto dismissing weekend price action as a standard chart feature. “This price action happens most weekends. Note: one key to proper T.A is being able to identify what happened, what’s happening and what is likely to happen,” part of a tweet read on May 1. Under the hood, on-chain activity tells a compelling story of Bitcoin growth during its 2023 comeback. Recorded by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, among others, the daily transaction count for Bitcoin is approaching all-time highs after this year saw an “explosive” increase. In a Twitter thread investigating the overall strength of the BTC price uptrend, Glassnode acknowledged that on-chain volume had yet to match it. “Bitcoin transaction counts, address activity, Inscriptions, and Mempool congestion are all elevated. As is the degree of HODLing, and supply acquired below $30k,” it commented. An accompanying chart showed unspent realized price distributed of various market cohorts. Continuing, Glassnode lead on-chain analyst Checkmate remained upbeat on Bitcoin continuing its rally and the late-2022 lows marking a local bottom. “Best Estimate --> Uptrend justified, and floor most likely in,” he wrote , summarizing the latest research. While the price has been wavering, crypto market sentiment has been creeping higher after a drop in late April. Related: Bitcoin price can ‘easily’ hit $20K in next 4 months — Philip Swift The latest readings from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index show that market “greed” is trending back toward levels last seen at Bitcoin’s $69,000 all-time high in November 2021. A lagging indicator, the index nonetheless shows the ease with which sentiment is currently being influenced by comparatively small market shifts. This, in turn, reiterates the importance of current resistance levels for Bitcoin and Ether ( ETH ) in particular, with both assets facing key lines in the sand of $30,000 and $2,000, respectively.

  "description": "The regulator nabbed the crypto ATM operator turned exchange for securities law violations over its sales and statements of a crypto token.",
  "content": "The United States securities regulator has handed down nearly $4 million in fines to crypto exchange Coinme for allegedly offering unregistered securities and giving “misleading statements” on its crypto token UpToken (UP). On April 28 the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it settled charges against Coinme, its subsidiary Up Global SEZC and the CEO of both firms, Neil Bergquist. Up Global agreed to pay a $3.52 million penalty, for which Coinme was also liable. Separate penalties against Coinme and Bergquist of $250,000 and $150,000 respectively were also leveled, which both have agreed to pay. In its order , the SEC alleged Coinme, Up Global and Bergquist’s Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of UP between October to December 2017 was an investment contract under the Howey test and were subsequently unregistered securities offerings. The ICO raised around $3.6 million to expand the amount of Bitcoin ( BTC ) ATMs in Coinme’s fleet, with which it added 30 ATMs using ICO funding. UP holders received benefits such as discounted fees and a 1% cashback paid in UP when using the ATMs. In January 2019, Coinme changed its offering and partnered with Coinstar to use its cash-counting kiosks to facilitate cash-to-crypto transactions rather than its own ATMs. By July 2019 Coinme shut down all of its own ATMs. “There is currently no use for UpToken, and UpToken holders can no longer use UpToken to obtain the benefits that were described in the UpToken offering materials.” The price of UP has seen a significant drawdown since, with its market cap also falling to around $50,000 and 24-hour trading volumes topping just over $180. Bergquist and Up Global also made “false and misleading statements” about the demand for UpToken and the amount raised in the offering, according to the SEC. Up Global said Coinme’s purchasing of UP to fund its ATM rewards program would create constant demand for the token, but the SEC said: “Bergquist and Up Global took steps before and throughout the ICO to obtain an UpToken supply that would substantially reduce Coinme's need to purchase UpToken after the ICO for the ATM rewards program.” The SEC claimed that Coinme sent 160 BTC, worth over $1 million at the time, to an Up Global wallet used to receive investor funds in the ICO. Up Global sent back around 14.5 million UP at a discount to Coinme, and the transaction “knowingly or recklessly” created the impression that a third party made a large purchase. Related: Rep. McHenry announces hearings to address market structure around crypto In another example, it was claimed Bergquist negotiated a 500 Bitcoin round-trip transaction of UP tokens with an unnamed Hong Kong company, with Coinme borrowing the funds to purchase further UP at a discount. The transaction was also used to create an impression of demand for the tokens. The SEC said Bergquist didn’t admit or deny the regulator’s findings, agreed to settle the charges and was barred from acting as an executive of a public company for three years.

  "description": "Ordinals have been a controversial topic within the Bitcoin community but crypto investment firm Grayscale says there’s two main reasons to be optimistic.",
  "content": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) Ordinals — also known by some as Bitcoin NFTs — could renew developer enthusiasm for Bitcoin and boost mining fees, according to cryptocurrency investment firm Grayscale. In an April 27 “Market Byte” blog post, the firm suggested that Ordinals provide two key benefits to the growth and development of the Bitcoin ecosystem. #Ordinals have generated a great deal of attention in the crypto ecosystem by introducing #NFT -like assets on the #Bitcoin blockchain. @mzhao8 and our research team explore their potential in our latest Market Byte: https://t.co/7muc9Lyrok The first is a substantial increase in fees paid to miners, which has been seen since the launch of the protocol in January , according to Grayscale. Grayscale argued that this would ensure “continued network security throughout the lifetime of the Bitcoin network.” As reported by Cointelegraph, in less than two months after its launch, more than $600,000 was paid to Bitcoin miners, solely as the result of fees generated by Ordinal inscriptions. As of the time of publication, that figure now exceeds the $6.5 million mark. The investment firm also believes that Ordinals and the “velocity of NFT adoption” could also attract new Bitcoin users and spark more development on the Bitcoin network. On April 30, Ordinals reached a new record, with the number of daily inscriptions topping 300,000. Around the same time, the number of Bitcoin transactions neared peaks not seen in a number of years, according to blockchain data firm IntoTheBlock. Related: Magic Eden launches marketplace for Bitcoin Ordinals The meteoric rise of Ordinals has been a controversial topic in the wider Bitcoin community, with Bitcoin maximalists extensively criticizing them for straying from the original purpose of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic currency and clogging up valuable block space. One such critic is Blockstream CEO Adam Back, who has declared Ordinals to be “useless” and saythat he is “more into Bitcoin as a currency.” \"you can't stop them\" well ofc! bitcoin is designed to be censor resistant. doesn't stop us mildly commenting on the sheer waste and stupidity of an encoding. at least do something efficient. otherwise it's another proof of consumption of block-space thingy.",

  "content": "Picture this: you’re a crypto novice that has just discovered the wonders of Polygon (MATIC), Cardano (ADA), and Signuptoken.com (SUT) . Eager to boost your financial assets using these cryptos and leverage the power of smart contracts, you meticulously input your contact address, ensuring a seamless and transparent transaction. Undoubtedly, these experiences highlight the crucial role of smart contracts in the crypto space. Get ready to explore the significance of smart contracts in the context of two prominent cryptos — Polygon and Cardano. Plus, we’ll touch on the latest buzz around SUT’s newly released contact address. Polygon Labs Seeks EU Government To Modify Smart Contracts On Data Act Smart contracts are self-executing agreements that run on blockchain networks without the need for intermediaries. To improve transparency and efficiency for all its user base, Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution Polygon Labs has requested European Union (EU) authorities to define the parameters of the Data Act’s smart contract-targeting law. Polygon Labs, the developer of Polygon, suggested changing Article 30 of the Data Act to only apply to permissioned smart-contract-based systems owned and run by organizations, as opposed to unfettered systems, in an open letter. The business raised worries that the legislation’s current wording may stifle innovation and EU economic expansion. For consistency, Polygon Labs also asked that the Data Act be in line with the Markets in Crypto-Assets framework. As per CoinTelegraph , Polygon’s request has been made prior to the final vote on the Markets in Crypto-Assets framework, which is scheduled to occur on April 19 and comes after lengthy negotiations between the European Parliament, the European Council, and the European Commission. The Data Act is projected to go through a similar process of deliberation by EU parliamentarians before taking on its final form, allowing Polygon Labs’ concerns to be taken into account. Signuptoken.com Reveals Contact Address Signuptoken.com has not yet been released on the blockchain, but once it does, its smart contract functionality will undoubtedly help ensure the security and efficiency of its user base. But what’s sure of SUT is the recent release of its contact address, which serves as a unique identifier for transactions and interactions on their blockchain network. This enables interoperability, ownership verification, and helps maintain security and privacy within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What is Signuptoken.com? Signuptoken.com (SUT) is making waves in the crypto world with its innovative features and commitment to user satisfaction. From an exclusive Millionaires Club to a referral program and audits from reputable organizations — Solidity Finance and CoinSniper — SUT is all about maximizing financial growth while ensuring top-notch security. With their unique approach to fundraising and ambitious plans to launch on Uniswap, SUT is ready to disrupt the crypto space and help users achieve early retirement goals. Cardano’s Smart Contract Tool: Aiken Smart contracts are a vital feature of blockchain networks, automating digital agreements without intermediaries. Acknowledging its importance, Cardano recently announced the launch of Aiken, an open-source smart contract language and toolchain aimed at improving the process of creating smart contracts on the Cardano network. Aiken addresses issues related to smart contract writing and aims to enhance the interconnectivity between Haskell and other off-chain languages. The announcement of Aiken has resulted in positive price movements for Cardano, surging ADA’s prices upon its release last week. Aiken includes features such as fast compiler feedback, automated code formatting, and a compatible language server for editors, which streamline and expedite the creation of smart contracts. The Aiken team will conduct thorough audits to ensure compliance with expected criteria, contributing to a smoother mainnet launch. This innovation highlights the importance of smart contracts in blockchain networks, as they enable trust, automation, and efficiency, and innovations like Aiken are significant for enhancing the capabilities and adoption of smart contracts in the Cardano ecosystem. Smart contracts play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency space, as demonstrated by recent developments in Polygon (MATIC), Cardano (ADA), and Signuptoken.com (SUT). These evolutions underscore the importance of smart contracts in blockchain networks and their potential for revolutionizing the crypto space.

  "description": "Circle launches cross-chain transfer protocol, Visa shares plans for stablecoin product, Kraken fights back in court, and more.",
  "content": "Circle launched a cross-chain protocol that enables USDC transfers between the Ethereum and Avalanche blockchains. The protocol works by burning the selected amount of native USDC on the source chain, and minting an equivalent amount of new USDC on the intended destination chain. The protocol essentially makes USDC transfers between the two networks faster and more user-friendly, as prior to its launch, people had to use third-party bridges or a Circle partner to facilitate transfers between the two networks. Additional support for Solana and other blockchains will be added later in 2023. Cuy Sheffield, the head of crypto at Visa, announced a new cryptocurrency-related project, on April 24, focused on stablecoin payments . Details are sparse at this stage; however, Sheffiled shared a job listing relating to the project, with the description noting that the “Visa Crypto Team is building the next generation of products to facilitate commerce in everyone’s digital and mobile lives.” The job listing is seeking candidates with a good understanding of layer-1 and layer-2 solutions, alongside experience with writing smart contracts using the programming language Solidity, among other things. Crypto exchange Kraken has fought back against the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) over what it feels is an “unjustified treasure hunt” for user’s trading info. According to court documents, the firm requested a federal court in San Francisco to intervene and ask the IRS to back off. The IRS issued a summons in February demanding additional information on Kraken users who traded $20,000 or more in any single year from 2016 to 2020. Meta disclosed in its Q1 earnings report that its metaverse unit, Reality Labs, posted a loss of around $4 billion during the quarter. In what has been a costly venture for the firm, the $4 billion loss adds to the $14 billion Reality Labs loss over the entirety of 2022. Still, Meta posted a profit totalling roughly $5.7 billion in Q1 overall, with the firm’s work on artificial intelligence somewhat curbing the losses. Mark Zuckerberg was also not phased by the loss from Reality Labs, as he reiterated that “we continue to expect Reality Labs operating losses to increase year-over-year in 2023” as the firm eyes growth in the long term. Viral clips of Securities and Exchange Commision chair Gary Gensler started circulating this week , showing him take a highly contradictory stance on crypto compared to what he holds now. As it stands, Gensler thinks almost every crypto asset apart from BTC is a security, and has pushed hard to regulate the crypto sector from that viewpoint. However, in a snippet from one of his “Blockchain and Money” lectures from 2018 — while he was working as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — Gensler said, “Three quarters of the market is non-securities, it’s just a commodity, cash, crypto.” He even suggested Ether was not a security, despite repeatedly suggesting otherwise over the past couple years. At the end of the week, Bitcoin ( BTC ) is at $29,275 , Ether ( ETH ) at $1,900 and XRP at $0.47 . The total market cap is at $1.2 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. Among the biggest 100 cryptocurrencies, the top three altcoin gainers of the week are Render Token (RNDR) at 40.91%, Cronos (CRO) at 13.47% and Injective (INJ) at 10.49%. The top three altcoin losers of the week are PancakeSwap (CAKE) at 19.13%, Zilliqa (ZIL) at 12.41% and Optimism (OP) at 11.26%.

Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle David Sacks, co-host of the All-In podcast Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum co-founder Perianne Boring , CEO of the Chamber of Digital Commerce Julian Hosp , CEO and co-founder of Cake DeFi After the House Republicans scarcely passed their bill to increase the U.S. debt ceiling on April 26, market analysts promptly started weighing up its potential impact on the price of Bitcoin (BTC). Analysts such as the chief operating officer of investment firm Onramp, Jesse Meyers, believe that raising the debt ceiling will likely prompt the Federal Reserve to print more money, thus boosting capital inflows into “risky” assets like BTC. “When the debt ceiling is lifted and credit-contraction leads to economic crisis… They will have to print money on a massive scale,” he noted. “#Bitcoin was the winner during the last round of stimulus.” Ethereum-based decentralized finance protocol Ordinals Finance, was accused of performing a rug pull . The protocol enables users to lend and borrow inscriptions. However, blockchain security firm CertiK reported that the protocol’s developer abruptly pulled 256 million OFI tokens out of its smart contracts using a “safuToken” function. According to CertiK, another 13 million OFI was then removed through an “ownerRewithdraw” function, bringing the total number of withdrawn tokens to 269 million. In total, the reported loss to investors was estimated to be around $1 million, almost half of the total OFI market cap. According to research from pseudonymous blockchain sleuth ZachXBT posted, on April 26, one specific wallet address launched “114 memecoin scams” over the previous 45 days. ZachXBT tracked the 0x739c58807B99Cb274f6FD96B10194202b8EEfB47 address, and found that stolen funds from scams are continually sent to this address. ZachXBT was unable to calculate how much the funds equated to, as the alleged scammer used multiple wallets to split up funds. “I suspect there are more too. These are just ones sent to that deposit address lol,” ZachXBT wrote. According to Google Ads data coupled with blockchain analytics, over $4 million has been stolen from people that clicked on malicious phishing websites that mimic legitimate crypto platforms. It marks a concerning trend for the crypto community, given that these dubious websites are promoted on Google search results and closely replicate real platforms.

  "content": "Tencent Cloud — the cloud services provider arm of Chinese tech giant Tencent — has launched a new digital human production platform allowing users to create deepfakes of any individual based on a three-minute video clip and 100 sentences of voice material. Tencent Cloud’s deepfake generator uses Tencent’s in-house artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to recreate fake videos of an individual. Scammers have widely adopted deepfake videos to mislead investors by impersonating prominent figures. In 2022, Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned against the rising number of deepfakes impersonating him to promote cryptocurrency scams. Yikes. Def not me. As reported by local media Jiemian, Tencent Cloud’s service can analyze and train itself on three-minute videos and 100 voice clips to produce a convincing deepfake video within 24 hours. The deepfake creation service costs roughly 1,000 yuan or $145. News media outlet The Register reportedly confirmed the development with Tencent and highlighted that the service could develop deepfakes in Chinese and English. The creation of digital humans is offered in five styles: 3D realistic, 3D semi-realistic, 3D cartoon, 2D real person and 2D cartoon. Tencent intends to use the service for hosting live-streamed infomercials for the Chinese demographic. Jiemian’s report reveals that other applications of deepfakes may include representing “doctors, lawyers and other professionals.” Related: Here’s how to quickly spot a deepfake crypto scam — cybersecurity execs Simultaneously, other Chinese tech giants, including Huawei and Baidu, have started developing their own versions of generative AI tools to rival market leader ChatGPT.
