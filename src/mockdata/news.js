        "The so-called “bipartisan” legislation on stablecoins proved divisive in Congress once its first draft was published.",
      content:
        "Democrats blasted draft legislation regarding stablecoins on Wednesday for not being as “bipartisan” as initially planned. The bill, created by Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) last year, was praised by Republicans, but criticized by their left-wing counterparts as ‘outdated.’ Starting From Scratch The House Financial Services Committee published a draft version of the stablecoin bill on April 15, designed to “provide requirements for payment stablecoin issuers,” alongside “research on a digital dollar.” Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to fiat currencies like dollars or euros, acting like digital dollars that don’t use a bank, and instead use the settlement assurances of blockchain. The presently unnamed legislation was discussed at length between Waters, McHenry, and other members of Congress last year, with the Treasury Department contributing to create the first concrete laws tailored to a significant portion of the crypto industry. Yet when actually reading the completed first draft during a committee hearing on Wednesday, Waters said the bill felt wholly different from what had been discussed. “Mr. McHenry alarmed me somewhat when he said that the members on his side of the aisle had come up with a whole new bill,” Waters said. “The posted bill in no way represents … negotiations between the two of us … I think we’re starting from scratch.” Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.), the senior Democrat on the digital assets subcommittee, questioned the very function of stablecoins, noting that they’re more frequently used for “speculative cryptocurrency trading and investments” than for actual payments. The Optimistic View McHenry, who serves as committee chair, objected to this stance, saying the bill is important “both internationally and domestically.” ADVERTISEMENT Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.) also found that the bill was more bipartisan than given credit for, calling it “Maxine McHenry.” Both McHenry and Waters agreed, however, that much had happened since the last negotiations on the bill took place – including the collapse of FTX. They also agreed that fast action was needed to update the bill and ensure the United States got up to speed with the rest of the world. The proposed bill would disallow any business from issuing stablecoins besides subsidiaries of insured depository institutions, or licensed non-bank entities.

        "Space and Time – a decentralized blockchain data warehouse – has announced that its service is now available on the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. This will enable the platform’s developers to onboard enterprise data to smart contract applications, alongside new use cases for indexed blockchain data. Space and Time combines real-time data from major blockchains with off-chan data indexed by customers. Meanwhile, Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform that lets users access a range of applications, or develop and scale new applications. Microsoft’s venture capital fund, M12, led a funding round for Space and Time in September 2022. “At Microsoft, we are empowering growth across emerging markets – including blockchain and distributed data,” stated Kathleen Mitford, CVP of Global Industry Marketing at Microsoft, in a press release shared with CryptoPotato. Space and Time CEO and Co-Founder, Nate Holiday, added that the need for real-time data across blockchains, enterprises, and AI has “never been more important.” In February, Ankr partnered with Microsoft to provide services for enterprise-grade node hosting.

      content:
        "Web3 wallet provider, MetaMask took Twitter to deny claims that a “massive wallet-draining operation” originated from an exploit of its wallet. The update comes after Taylor Mohanan alleged that an attacker was “sending” transactions via MetaMask, draining crypto from long-time users and employees. Mohanan, who also happens to be a MetaMask developer, later confirmed that the attack was not MetaMask-specific. The “sophisticated” heist was first discovered by Monahan early this week. According to her original post, the attack resulted in the loss of more than 5,000 ETH and an undetermined quantity of tokens and NFTs since December 2022. The attacker deliberately targeted “OGs who are reasonably secure,” as per Monahan’s analysis, which added that no one has figured out where the exploit lies. In a series of tweets, MetaMask confirmed that its platform was not exploited in any way. “Recent reporting on (Monahan’s) thread has incorrectly claimed that a massive wallet-draining operation is a result of a MetaMask exploit. This is incorrect. This is not a MetaMask-specific exploit.” The wallet provider further went on add that its security team is working with affected wallet providers across the space to locate the source. It said that the attacker withdrew 5,000 ETH from different addresses across 11 blockchains rather than only from its platform users. Even as details regarding the hacker’s methods remain unclear, the wallet keys of all the victims were created between 2014 and 2022.

      content:
        "SpaceX CEO and Dogecoin enthusiast Elon Musk announced on Tuesday that the company is targeting April 20 for a test flight of its Starship rocket. As it happens, April 20 (4/20) is celebrated by the Dogecoin community as “Doge Day.” April 20 was declared Doge Day by the Doge community back in 2021 with an aim of pushing the coin’s value to new highs. April 2021 was when Doge rocketed to new highs around $0.30, before soaring to $0.70 in early May. “The team is working around the clock on many issues. Maybe 4/20, maybe not,” tweeted Musk about the launch on Tuesday. The launch was originally scheduled for April 17 before Musk tweeted about a “pressurant valve” being frozen, delaying the takeoff. Some in the Dogecoin community, however, think this is part of Musk’s “masterful plan” to launch a rocket on Doge Day. HOLD YOUR DOGE Starship launch has been moved to April 20th, Doge Day! @dogecoin Rumor has it that it's all part of @elonmusk 's masterful plan.Is this his way of celebrating? How will this momentous event impact the markets?#dogeday420 #bitgetdogeday pic.twitter.com/7tkK0HjON9 — Bitget (@bitgetglobal) April 19, 2023 “The launch of the biggest rocket on the planet, delayed for the sake of memes, tweeted Dogecoin graphic designer DogeDesigner on Monday “All hail the meme-lord.” Dogecoin Foundation member Marshall Hayner also posted a simple “420” possibly referring to Doge Day. In 2021, SpaceX helped plan a Dogecoin-funded rocket launch to the moon, further away from Earth’s surface than any other CubeSat had ever reached. The mission was named “DOGE-1”.

        "The analyst believes that if Nasdaq and Bitcoin keep rallying, BTC mining stocks will keep outperforming.",
      content:
        "Several public Bitcoin miners were on the brink of bankruptcy at the end of last year. But the latest rally in the market infused a sense of careful optimism into the Bitcoin mining sector, resulting in massive gains for most associated stocks. Bitcoin Mining Stocks for the Win As Bitcoin miners slowly escape the incessant bear trap, stocks related to the sector are now seeing a notable resurgence. According to BTC mining expert Jaran Mellerud, bitcoin mining stocks have suddenly rallied alongside the price of the flagship crypto-asset in 2023, allowing “wound-licking mining stock investors to regain some of their massive losses.” As BTC amassed 80% YTD gains, the HI Crypto Mining Stock Index raked 115% during the same period. In the process, the industry’s leading mining firms have not only outpaced Bitcoin itself but also the top tech stocks. Even the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 Index only managed a 20% gain so far this year. Best Performing Miners At the top, Core Scientific positioned itself as the best-performing Bitcoin mining firm so far in 2023. It was one of the many companies that filed for bankruptcy last year. It had accused Celsius of failing to pay its power bills and subsequently cited the non-payment as a major factor in the liquidity issues. Even so, its stocks recorded an astonishing 455% in gains. Mellerud, in his analysis, explained that its massive debt boosted its equity this year. The miner’s cash flows relative to equity have been “positively affected (but disproportionately so) by the improvements in mining economics.” Meanwhile, Digihost, Cipher, Riot, Iris Energy, and Marathon also performed well. Most of these mining firms have relatively low debt levels relative to equity and are thus significantly less financially leveraged than Core Scientific, Mellerud observed. The analyst further pointed out the resemblance of the current market cycle to that of Bitcoin’s mini bull cycle of 2019, where the crypto-asset surged by 260% from bottom to top. If this cycle repeats, bitcoin is expected to top out at $42k sometime this year. This also means that Bitcoin mining stocks are likely to soar, as well.

        "Bitcoin’s price has experienced a significant surge in recent months, surpassing several resistance levels. However, the current trend seems to be losing momentum, with the cryptocurrency experiencing difficulty in claiming the crucial resistance zone of $30K. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart The price has broken out of its narrow consolidation range near $28K and is now aggressively attempting to breach the crucial resistance level at $30K. This level holds both psychological and technical resistance and is likely to determine the crypto market’s short-term future. Should Bitcoin succeed in surpassing it, this may trigger a bullish trend toward the next significant resistance zone of around $38K. However, if it fails to break through, a drop toward the 50-day moving average at $26K or the mid-trendline of the channel at approximately $25K may occur. Regardless of the outcome, the bulls can remain hopeful as long as the price stays above the 200-day moving average, a crucial indicator for identifying the market’s overall bias. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart When examining the 4-hour timeframe, it becomes evident that the price of Bitcoin has recently formed a head-and-shoulders pattern, indicating an increased probability of an upcoming short-term reversal. However, it’s important to note that if the pattern results in a rejection, the multi-month ascending trendline will assume a more critical role as a primary support region. Despite the development of this pattern, Bitcoin’s price currently finds itself in a state of limbo, confined within the dynamic range that exists between the ascending trendline and the critical $30K resistance area. Consequently, its direction in the mid-term remains uncertain and dependent on a breakout beyond this range. Source: TradingView On-chain Analysis By Shayan The Realized Price metric is a crucial tool in determining whether Bitcoin is over or undervalued. During bullish market cycles, it typically remains above the realized price, while during bear markets, it drops below, causing fear and uncertainty. Bitcoin’s recent movements resemble the 2018 bear market. During the final capitulation phase, the price dropped significantly below the realized price, causing panic. However, the 2019 bull run saw it reclaim the realized price level at around $4K and form a pullback to retest it. Recently, BTC dropped below the realized price but then started a strong uptrend, surpassing the realized price at $20K. After a brief surge, it corrected and retested the level, indicating a healthy bullish trend. However, Bitcoin’s bullish outlook remains unchanged unless it drops below the realized price level.

      content:
        "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman – Gary Gensler – affirmed during testimony before the House Financial Services Committee that the agency will keep insisting that local crypto platforms abide by strict laws. Committee Chairman Rep. Patrick McHenry argued that the regulator’s aggressive approach could drive such firms away from the USA and hamper innovation. Gensler also said he has never owned any digital assets, classifying them as “highly speculative.” It is worth noting that his stance was not that negative at the beginning of his reign at the SEC when he was “intrigued” by the crypto sector. Exchanges ‘Don’t Have a Choice’ Gensler faced huge criticism from House Republicans on April 18, who claimed the SEC’s actions have weakened America’s status as a center for cryptocurrency innovation. Committee Chairman Rep. Patrick McHenry stated: “Your approach is driving innovation overseas and endangering American competitiveness.” He also believes the agency should not rely on “regulation by enforcement,” labeling the method as insufficient and unsustainable. “You’re punishing digital asset firms for allegedly not adhering to the law when they don’t know it will apply to them,” he added. Gensler denied the thesis that US crypto exchanges don’t know how to abide by the law. He thinks there is a clear regulatory framework built many years ago, while such platforms are “just a bunch of intermediaries in this market” that should follow up the guidance: “We have a whole field in crypto that understands the law, and if they are providing exchange services, broker-dealer services, clearing services of crypto security tokens, they should come into compliance. They don’t have a choice. They’re noncompliant generally, and they need to come into compliance.” Gary Gensler, Source: Bloomberg The regulatory uncertainty in the world’s biggest economy has already become an obstacle for some crypto organizations. Brian Armstrong – CEO of Coinbase – recently hinted that his platform might relocate if the domestic watchdogs do not implement proper legislation on the industry. Gensler is not a HODLer The SEC Chairman also declared he has never personally owned bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies, adding that the only digital assets he has are his “bank account” and “brokerage account.” Despite not being asked about his view, he called the asset class “highly speculative.” Gensler was not that hostile toward the sector during the first months of his election as a leader of the Commission. He admitted his affection to the market in the summer of 2021, explaining he had spent years to understand it: “While I’m neutral on the technology, even intrigued, I spend three years teaching it, leaning into it – I’m not neutral about investor protection. If somebody wants to speculate, that’s their choice, but we have a role as a nation to protect those investors against fraud.” The post Gary Gensler: The SEC Will Not Change its Attitude Toward Crypto Exchanges appeared first on CryptoPotato.",

        "[PRESS RELEASE – Singapore, Singapore, April 19th, 2023] JustLend DAO has announced the launch of two new features – “Staked TRX” and “Energy Rental,” aimed at providing users with more flexible and streamlined options while reducing energy rental costs. This major upgrade, released on April 16, expands the reach of JustLend DAO’s capability to multiply users’ benefits by putting their assets into active use. STAKED TRX The new “Staked TRX” feature is based on Stake 2.0 and allows users to earn high yields by staking TRX then receiving sTRX tokens. With “Staked TRX,” the platform automatically earns yields for users via (a) voting rewards as the platform automatically votes for Super Representatives with their staked TRX and (b) renting out the Energy obtained by staking, resulting in higher yields and a much simpler staking process. As voting rewards and rents accrue, the exchange rate of TRX to sTRX will rise accordingly, thus increasing total yields. ENERGY RENTAL The new “Energy Rental” feature provides a more cost-effective alternative to obtaining Energy by staking or burning Energy. Users can rent Energy or end their rental at any time, and the new process is less complicated and less expensive. ADVANCED DECENTRALIZATION TRON Stake 2.0 makes resource and voting management remarkably more flexible than its predecessor, Stake 1.0. JustLend DAO, the first TRON-based decentralized financial platform, now allows users to earn yields through supplied assets, borrow digital assets against collateral, participate in TRX staking, and rent Energy. The launch of Staked TRX and Energy Rental is expected to spawn a fully decentralized resource market. The resources and votes already obtained via staking in Stake 1.0 remain valid, and the staked TRX can be redeemed as usual. However, please take note that users may only stake TRX in Stake 2.0 going forward. EXPANDING ECOSYSTEM TRONSCAN statistics, as of April 18, 2023, show an expansive user base of more than 154.3 million TRON accounts and a total transfer volume of more than $7.35 trillion. The launch of Staked TRX and Energy Rental frees TRON users from their headaches and elevates their user experience. This upgrade empowers JustLend DAO with a new level of efficiency, catering to the massive demand from TRON’s users. JustLend DAO also plans to launch a JST buyback-and-burn program with its revenue to facilitate sustained, healthy growth of the JST ecosystem. Further details will be forthcoming. In the spirit of decentralization, TRON community members have been using applications related to the TRON Energy Market like TRONPulse Energy Pool, the TRON NRG Marketplace, and Token Goodies. JustLend DAO is excited about the services these and other solutions have been providing and hopes they will continue with much success. An ever-increasing amount of TRON users results in an ever-increasing amount of transactions, which requires an abundance of Energy marketplaces to strengthen and scale utility across the ecosystem. JustLend DAO champions these solutions as well as any others that emerge as the TRON ecosystem expands. The two new features of Staked TRX and Energy Rental from JustLend DAO demonstrate yet another way that the TRON blockchain is empowering decentralized commerce and community for every person on the planet.

        "[PRESS RELEASE – Central, Singapore, April 19th, 2023] HeartX, an artwork marketplace and community platform, just announced that its app product starts the Close Beta Test today. It’s available now on both App Store and HeartX official website, but only people with the limited invitation code can register as community members and start earning by voting. The Close Beta of the HeartX app introduces people to their Vote-to-Earn system, which is the beginning of its X-to-Earn ecosystem that the HeartX team has planned. Those interested can acquire the invitation code by following HeartX on Twitter to participate in specific activities and taking part in events on Discord. Some events will also be held on influencers’ or collab partners’ Twitter accounts to give away the code. The earlier users are in, the more tokens they can earn. HeartX also announced that by the end of April, most of the smart contracts will be deployed on Layer 2 of Ethereum to reduce the cost of gas fees and bring users a better art trading experience. The NFT trading feature will not be opened during the Closed Beta test, and users are encouraged to keep the rewarding $HNX at this moment. According to the whitepaper, in the future users can consume $HNX in various scenarios such as Boost-to-Earn, Level up, and In-app applications purchases, etc. The team is continuing to develop the HeartX project and looks forward to sharing updates with the community.
